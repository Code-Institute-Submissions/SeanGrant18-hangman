## Testing

Testing was a diffucult task but i was able to bring Hangman to life by the help of the Student Care team and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). At first the app was not deploying to heroku, this was a tedious task but was overcome by some help.

## Deployment

This project was deployed to heroku by first creating an account with heroku, setting up the heroku app and making sure all the settings were correct.

## Credits 

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) helped me with the majority of the python code.
